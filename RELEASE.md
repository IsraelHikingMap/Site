In order to release a version the following steps need to be made:
1. Go to appveyor to see what's the last version that is there: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/IsraelHikingHost/site/history
2. Create a git tag with an incremented by 1 version number on top of the latest Appveyor version: `git tag v9.9.99`
3. Push the tag to make the appveyor build run: `git push origin v9.9.99`
4. Check that a new build has started on Appveyor with the new tag.
5. Go to [Milestones](https://github.com/IsraelHikingMap/Site/milestones), change the "Next Release" milestone name to `Version 9.9.99` save and close.
6. Create a new milestone called "Next Release". Open the recently closed milestone and move all the non-closed items to "Next Release".
7. Go to the closed issued. Copy the link from the addressbar - this link should be used in the stores to allow users to see which issues were closed in that release. The link should be something like: `https://github.com/IsraelHikingMap/Site/milestone/39?closed=1`
8. Edit the Milestone description with a draft for the release description using the following template:
