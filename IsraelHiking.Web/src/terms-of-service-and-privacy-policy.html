            <h2 class="heading-element">Changes and amendments</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its policies relating to the Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Agreement in the mobile application or website.

            <h1 class="heading-element">Privacy policy</h1>
            <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how "Mapeak" ("Mapeak", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the Mapeak mobile application, the Mapeak website and any of its products or services (collectively, "Services").</p>
            <p>It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Automatic collection of information</h2>
            <p>When you open the the Services our servers automatically record information that your device sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in our mobile application and website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
            <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Services traffic and usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Collection of personal information</h2>
            <p>You can visit the the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Services' features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, make a purchase, or fill any online forms in the Services. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
                <li>Geolocation data of the mobile device such as latitude and longitude.</li>
                <li>Certain features on the mobile device such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc.</li>
                <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Services' features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Managing personal information</h2>
            <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, please contact us.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Storing personal information</h2>
            <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
            <p>In order to make our Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information.

This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
            <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Information transfer and storage</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">The rights of users</h2>
            <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.

            <h2 class="heading-element">The right to object to processing</h2>
            <p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">How to exercise these rights</h2>

The Store is also responsible for providing us with confirmation of your eligibility for purchased services.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Privacy of children</h2>
            <p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to Personal Information we may collect from children and take many special precautions to protect the privacy of children. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use the Services. We encourage children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any mobile application and website, including Mapeak. We believe parents should be involved in the online activities of their children and suggest that parents do their best to provide their children with a safe and friendly online environment.</p>

When we do, we will post a notice in the Services.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-element">Legal disclosure</h2>
            <p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
