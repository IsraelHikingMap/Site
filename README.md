# Technology stack
The technology stack of this site is based on the following frameworks:
* [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - for sanity
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Angular-Material](https://material.angular.io/) - for UI framework and components 
* [MapLibre](https://docs.maplibre.org/) using [ngx-maplibre-gl](https://github.com/maplibre/ngx-maplibre-gl/) - for map presentation and interaction
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) - for unit testing.
* [Asp.Net core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) - for server side
* [NSubstitute](http://nsubstitute.github.io/) - for mocking server side tests
* [GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com/) - for routing between points
* [Elastic Search and NEST](https://www.elastic.co/) - for database and search capabilities
* [Net Topology Suite](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite) - for server side spatial mathmatics
* [Turf](https://turfjs.org/) - for client side spatial mathematics
* [OsmSharp](http://www.osmsharp.com/) - for OSM capabilities
* [Wikipedia using Wiki client library](https://github.com/CXuesong/WikiClientLibrary) - for Wikipedia data and upload images to Wikimedia common
* [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) - for uploading anonymous images
* [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) - for wrapping the site as a mobile application and add some native capabilities
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [angular-redux2](https://github.com/angular-redux2/store) - for state management in the client
* [Dexie](https://dexie.org/) - for client side storage
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - for image creation and micro-server architecture
* [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [ngx-d3](https://github.com/ZeevKatz/ngx-d3) - for advanced client side chart capablilities
* [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) and [ngx-lottie](https://github.com/ngx-lottie/ngx-lottie) - for image animations

# Architecture and folder stucture of UI
The architecture is based heavily on Angular:
* application - where all the application code is, topmost folder.
  * components - this layer handles the UI calls and bindings along with the relevant css and html files.
  * directives - folder for all the directives.
  * models - used to store data types that are common to the entire app.
  * reducers - used for redux reducers, actions and payloads.
  * services - this layer holds the lower level data handling.
    * layers - where the layers logic is - POI, route, wiki, nakeb, relevant services, etc...
* content - used for images and static content.
* environments - used for angular-cli to define production and dev variables.
* fonts - [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) generated font for icons instead of images.
* scss - used for global style files
* translations - all relevant data related to i18n.
 
# Architecture of Server
The architecture is based on layers:
* Contollers - the topmost layer to catch all the requests
* Services - responsible for orchestrating executors
* Converters - converters logic between types of geo structures
* Executers - basic logical building blocks
* DataAccessInterfaces - a slim layer to decouple business logic from data access
* DataAccess - database, file system and network request are processed in this layer
* Common - Mainly for POCOs

# Setting Up the Project for site Development (To setup iOS and Android follow the cordova guide)
In order to be able to build this site you'll need some tools:
* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Install [.Net core SDK 7.0 ](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (16.18+).
* Run from command line `dotnet restore` and after that `dotnet build`
* Go to `IsraelHiking.Web` and run from command line: 
  * `npm install` to install all npm packages for the client side code
  * `npm run build` to generate the Angular UI client. It should create `wwwroot` folder on a successful run
* Run `docker compose up graphhopper` - it should fail for the first time
* Run `gh-update.ps1` (set chmod +x if needed) to generate the graphhopper routing data
* Run `docker compose up` to load the rest of the sercives
* Run `dotnet run --project IsraelHiking.Web`
* If you want to update the translations or upload images from your debug environment, you'll need to add the following secrets to `IsraelHiking.Web`. Otherwise, skip this step.

  In the `secrets.json` at the end there should be these fields.
  ```
  {
    "wikiMediaUserName": "your wikimedia user",
    "wikiMediaPassword": "your wikimedia password"
    "zanataUserName": "your zanata user",
    "zanataApiKey": "your zanata api key",
    "imgurClientId": "your imgur client ID"
  }
  ```
